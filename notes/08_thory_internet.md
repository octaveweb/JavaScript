## What is isp?
> An ISP (Internet Service Provider) is a company that provides individuals and businesses with access to the internet through various technologies like DSL, cable, fiber-optic, or satellite. Without an ISP, you wouldn't be able to access the web, send emails, or stream media, making the ISP your essential gateway to online services. Customers pay ISPs for their services, with plans varying based on data usage or speed.
